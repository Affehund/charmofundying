## Overview

Curio of Undying is a mod that uses the Curios API to add a new slot, the Charm slot, to the player inventory and allows the Totem of Undying to be placed into this slot, either directly or through right-clicking with the totem held in hand. While the totem is in this slot, the player will be granted the same death protection effect as if it was held in the player's hand. This allows the player to gain the benefits of the totem without the hassle of needing to remember to hold the totem or the need to sacrifice a useful hotbar/inventory slot to keep one around.
